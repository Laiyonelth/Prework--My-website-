    <p> Life is a journey and you never know where it might lead you. At 26, life has taken me to several countries, where I have had the chance to get a better undertsanding of who I am and the commonalities we share as human beings despite our many cultural differences.
    I was born in Colombia and migrated to the United States for school when I was 16. Since the moment I arrived to the States, I felt the urge of learning more about the world. I had never been in such a multicultural environment and was fascinated by it. I love the idea of a melting pot and hope one day we as human overcome the challenges of having diferent ideologies to live in harmony.
    I chose to set roots in NYC because this city feels like the world in one place. Since 2020 I have not traveled as much as I used to because of the pandemic and the enviromental impacts of flying.</p>

    <p>I do look forward to traveling frequently again, once we have more enviromentally friendly ways of transportation. </p>

    <p>I believe traveling is transformational, and everyone should immerse themselves in a culture different than their own at least once in life. It is a transformational experience that changes your perception of life and the world in general. Some say you never know yourself until you leave your country of origin. Below is an interesting video on the importance of traveling"<p
